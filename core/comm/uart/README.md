uart
====

A Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) implemented in Verilog.

This UART used to be in coretest, but has been moved out as a separate
project.

The current implementation supports the ability to set the bit rate as
well as number of data- and stop bits by writing to control addresses
via the control interface.
