toggle
======
## Introduction ##

This repo contains a simple deign that toggles an ouput pin. The toggle
is in sync with the given sys_clk, but the toggle circuit divides down
the clock. The divisor is build time defined.

The design is used in the Cryptech FPGA design to observe internal
clock frequencies.


## Status ##
Has been simulated with Icarus Verilog.
